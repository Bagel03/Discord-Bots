# Discord-Folders

## A lightweight easy to use tool to help make discord bots more understandable

### Overview:

Discord-folders is a very compact and fast package that gives an easy way to set up and manage discord bots of any size. It's main feature is its ability to read your filesystem and generate a bot from that. This keeps files relitivly small and easy to manage, which helps if your bot gets big and so that you can easly predict how your bot will respond.

### Why you should use it:

Right now, if your making a discord bot you probally have one big `bot.js` file. This contains all the commands, features, and functions of your bot. If you bot is just sending _ping_ _pong_ back and forth, your problay good, but if your creating a lot of custom embeds, calling to a database, or just doing a lot in general, then it could get messy very fast. Take this example:

```js
import { Client } from "discord.js";

const client = new Client();

client.on("message", (message) => {
  if (!message.content.startsWith("!")) return;

  const commands = message.content.slice(1).toLowerCase().split(" ");

  switch (commands[0]) {
    case "info":
      // Request to the database to get info on message.author
      // Create a custom embed for them
      break;
    case "command info":
      switch (commands[1]) {
        case "subcommand-1":
          switch (commands[2]) {
            case "sub-subcommand-1":
              // Send message with all the info on this command, how its used, what it does, etc
              break;
            case "sub-subcommand-2":
              // Send info
              break;
            default:
            // Send an embed saying that command doesn't exist under this subcommand
          }
          break;
        case "subcommand-2":
          // Send message with all the info on this command
          break;
        default:
        // Send an embed saying that command doesn't exist
      }
      break;
  }

  if (database.getBlockedWordsRegex().match(message.content)) {
    // Delete the message
    // Send a embed telling them they broke the rules and have a strike
    // Update the database
  }
});

client.on("guildMemberAdded", (member) => {
  // Create a custom embed to say hi to this person
  // Automaticaly register them to the database with no strikes
});
```

This already looks really messy, and it is hard to tell what the bot is doing, not to mention that each one of those comments would be dozens of real lines of code, making imporovements on the bot even harder. Discord-Folders fixes this, so all that would just become:

```js
import {Bot} from "discord-folders";

const myBot = new Bot("!" __dirname + "\\src");

myBot.login(myToken)
```

Boom, 3 lines. Of course you would still have to write all the code to acutally make your bot do what you want, but no more switch statements, no more `client.on()`, and all your other code will be extreamly easy to understand, becuase it is spereated based on function:

_root/src/commands/info.js_

```js
export const onCalled = () => {
  // Request to the database to get info on message.author
  // Create a custom embed for them
};
```

Boom, easy to read and understand, and works exactly the same as before.
